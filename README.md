## About Me
### Description
> I'm a Systems and Electronics Engineering in course;  currently I'm coursing my 5th semester of degree. <br>
I'm very interested on software development and understanding the real power of developing and all the challenges involved, like
optimization; but my true passion are robotics and that's the reason why I'm studying Electronics Engineering. <br>
I don't like to stay with what I learn in the University and I've recently started to investigate about Artificial Inteligence 
and Machine Learning, I'm trying do get involved into this world by myself. <br>
I'm so happy with what I've done so far and I'm sure I'll do better in a near future. - Tony Montes (2021)
